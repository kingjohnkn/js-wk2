#### Write a program that takes a positive integer n as input and outputs the sum of all numbers between 1 and n that are divisible by 3 or 5 (or both).

For example, if n is 15, the program should output 45, since the numbers between 1 and 15 that are divisible by 3 or 5 are: 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10, and their sum is 45.

Here are some additional requirements and hints:
- Use a loop to iterate over all the numbers between 1 and n.
- Use an if statement and the modulus operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by 3 or 5.
- Use a variable to keep track of the running sum, and update it on each iteration of the loop.
- You can assume that the input n will be a positive integer.
